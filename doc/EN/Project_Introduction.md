### **Prologue: A Story of "Knowing, But Not Doing"**

Meet Alex, a talented individual trapped by "mental friction."

Alex feels unfulfilled in their current job and wants to pursue something they are truly passionate about. But whenever the thought arises, another voice immediately jumps in: "What if you fail?" "Are you really good enough?"

And so, Alex is caught in a prolonged "inner war." They want to change but are held back by their own fear and doubt, unable to move. **This state of "knowing, but not doing" is a deep-seated blockage that drains our passion for life and leaves us stagnant.**

By chance, Alex discovered "MyNearAI." Here, they began a different kind of "inner dialogue" and slowly learned to understand their internal conflicts. They realized that the "timid self" and the "aspiring self" were not enemies, but voices of different parts of their inner world.

Alex didn't quit their job immediately. But the mental friction ceased. Their life transformed from being "stuck" to "setting sail."

**MyNearAI didn't give Alex a standard answer, but it gave them the most important thing: inner integration and the courage to act.**

### **Chapter 1: The Ailment of Our Era: The High Cost of "Mental Friction"**

Alex's story is not unique. In this era of uncertainty, many face similar dilemmas:

*   We **know** we should go to bed early, but we scroll through short videos late at night.
*   We **know** we should exercise, but we spend the entire weekend on the couch.
*   We **know** we should focus, but we jump between notifications from countless apps.

We live in an age where "knowledge" is extremely cheap; we know "what is right" better than ever. But at the same time, our "ability to act" is scarcer than ever.

**The huge gap between "knowing" and "doing," and the resulting "mental friction," is becoming the most hidden and expensive cost of our time.** It not only consumes our time but also erodes our self-confidence, preventing us from becoming the person we want to be.

**We believe that solving the "mental friction" caused by "knowing, but not doing" is one of the most critical needs of our time.**

### **Chapter 2: Our Solution: A Dojo for "Knowing-Doing Unity"**

To address this fundamental challenge, we created **MyNearAI**.

It is not a lecturer of theories, nor an efficiency supervisor. It is a **dojo for practicing "knowing-doing unity."**

Its core is to provide you with an absolutely safe space to confront the moment of "knowing, but not doing." It will act as your wisest and most patient pair-programming partner, accompanying you to:

1.  **See the Block**: Helping you to see the invisible wall between "knowing" and "doing"â€”what is it really? Fear? Perfectionism? Resistance to the unknown?
2.  **Take a Micro-Action**: Instead of pursuing grand goals, it accompanies you in taking the smallest, yet most crucial, first step.
3.  **Practice on the Task**: In the process of solving specific problems, it subtly reintegrates the external "task" with the internal "mind."

**The philosophy of MyNearAI is: True change comes not from force of will, but from a unified mind.**

### **Chapter 3: What Makes Us Different: From "Tool" to "The AI You Own"**

1.  **Pillar 1: From "Giving Answers" to "Finding Them With You"**
    Unlike AIs that only give you standard answers, MyNearAI doesn't just tell you "what you should do." Through precise questioning, it guides you to see what you **truly want to do** deep down. It believes the answer has always been within you.

2.  **Pillar 2: From "Managing Behavior" to "Integrating the Mind"**
    We don't offer behavioral management tools like "Pomodoro timers" or "task lists." We offer a "mental practice" to be applied "on the task." We believe that when the inner mind is integrated, external actions naturally become orderly and powerful.

3.  **Pillar 3: A Revolution in Trust: You Truly Own Your AI**
    When dealing with your most authentic "knowing-doing conflicts," trust is everything. Traditional apps can only offer a "privacy policy" promise. MyNearAI, built on the NEAR Protocol, provides you with **verifiable and absolute ownership**:
    *   **Your AI is Yours**: Your AI agent is a digital asset deployed on the blockchain, like your crypto wallet, completely under your control. It's not a rented service; it's your property.
    *   **Absolute Data Privacy**: Your inner world belongs only to you. Through decentralized technology, you can ensure your data is completely under your control, not stored on any company's servers.
    *   **Trust Without Words**: You don't need to "trust" us, because on the blockchain, everything is public, transparent, and can be verified at any time. This is the ultimate, trustless trust endowed by technology.

### **Chapter 4: Our Starting Point: Serving the Creators Who Need "Knowing-Doing Unity" Most**

We believe "knowing-doing unity" is everyone's ultimate pursuit. But to hone our product in the most demanding environment, we chose a starting point: **Creators**, especially **Coders**.

They are the group that needs and understands "knowing-doing unity" the most. The hesitation of a line of code, the indecision of an architecture, are all fierce battles between "knowing" and "doing."

Our first product is **`MyNearAI for Coders`**. We hope to first provide this core group with a forge to turn "ideas" into "code," and then gradually bring the power of MyNearAI to everyone trapped by "knowing, but not doing."

We offer not just a product, but a new possibility:
**AI can be our strongest ally in integrating our minds and unleashing our potential. And this time, you will truly own it.**
