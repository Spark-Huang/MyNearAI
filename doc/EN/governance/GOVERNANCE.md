# MyNearAI Project Governance Model

## Introduction

The mission of the MyNearAI project is to build a decentralized dojo for practicing "knowing-doing unity" that is owned by its users. We believe that a healthy, transparent governance model that empowers community members is the cornerstone for achieving this mission. This document defines the roles, responsibilities, and decision-making processes of the MyNearAI community.

Our governance model aims to:
*   Provide a clear and predictable framework for participation and decision-making for all community members.
*   Empower more contributors to grow into the core strength of the community.
*   Ensure the project does not deviate from its core philosophy and values while iterating rapidly.

## Roles and Responsibilities

We define the following roles within the MyNearAI community:

*   **Users**: Every individual who uses MyNearAI products and provides feedback. You are the reason for the project's existence, and your voice is our most valuable asset.
*   **Contributors**: Any individual who makes a contribution to the project through concrete actions. This includes, but is not limited to:
    *   Submitting code (Pull Requests).
    *   Reporting and fixing bugs (Issues).
    *   Improving and translating documentation.
    *   Actively helping others in the community (Discussions).
    *   Proposing constructive product suggestions.
*   **Core Team**: A small group of contributors who have a long-term commitment to the project, are deeply involved, and are trusted by the community. They are the maintainers and main drivers of the project.
    *   **Responsibilities**:
        *   Setting the project's strategic direction and roadmap.
        *   Reviewing and merging code (Pull Requests).
        *   Maintaining project infrastructure and documentation.
        *   Nurturing and maintaining community health.
        *   Enforcing the Code of Conduct.

## Decision-Making Process

We follow the principle of "consensus first, final decision by core team."

1.  **Public Discussion**: All major technical, product, and governance decisions will be discussed publicly in GitHub Issues or Discussions. We encourage all community members to participate and share their views.
2.  **Seeking Consensus**: The Core Team will strive to seek consensus in community discussions. For most daily decisions, we will adhere to the general consensus of the community.
3.  **Core Team Resolution**: If a clear consensus cannot be reached, or if the decision involves the core strategy, roadmap, or philosophical direction of the project, the Core Team will make the final decision.
4.  **Proposal Process (RFC)**: For major new features or architectural changes, we will use a lightweight RFC (Request for Comments) process. Any contributor can initiate an RFC, and after thorough discussion, the Core Team will decide whether to adopt it.

## Becoming a Core Team Member

We hope that the MyNearAI Core Team will continuously absorb new blood from the community. The criteria for becoming a Core Team member are:
*   **Sustained and High-Quality Contributions**: Consistent, community-recognized contributions in areas such as code, documentation, and community support.
*   **Deep Understanding and Alignment**: A profound understanding of and alignment with the core philosophy and values of the MyNearAI project.
*   **Constructive Communication**: Demonstrated mature, respectful, and constructive communication skills.

The Core Team will periodically nominate new members from active contributors and issue a formal invitation after obtaining unanimous consent from the existing Core Team.

## Evolution of the Governance Model

This governance model is a "living document." As the community develops and matures, we will continuously review and revise it to better serve the project's mission and the well-being of the community. All major revisions to this model will follow the decision-making process described above.
