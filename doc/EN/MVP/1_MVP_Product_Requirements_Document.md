# MyNearAI MVP Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Web3 Edition

> **Version**: 1.0
> **Date**: 2025-07-06
> **Status**: Draft
> **Abstract**: This document defines the core value proposition and features of the MyNearAI product MVP, focusing on providing users with a complete "Inner Integration -> Knowing-Doing Transformation -> On-Chain Proof" experience, helping users solve the "knowing but not doing" problem and truly own their digital identity and growth assets.

## 1. Core Value Proposition

*   **Surface Value (The Hook)**: **Accompany you to see the block, integrate the conflict, and take the crucial first step.**
*   **Core Value (The Kernel)**: Through an efficient "inner integration" dialogue with your exclusive AI agent, transform inner conflicts into concrete "micro-actions," and forge this precious growth experience into a truly yours, immutable on-chain "Integration Crystal."

## 3. User Stories

**Target Persona**: The Web3 Developer troubled by the "knowing-doing gap"

| ID | As a... | I want to... | So that I can... |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| US-01 | a developer who knows I should refactor, but can't get started | see and resolve my inner fear and resistance. | stop the mental friction and actually start writing the first line of refactored code. |
| US-02 | a developer who wants to learn a new technology but is always put off by the thought "it's too hard" | have a partner to help me break down this huge goal and encourage me to complete the smallest learning unit. | turn the big goal of "learning" into small, daily actions. |
| US-03 | a developer who has just completed a long-procrastinated task | forge this precious "knowing-doing unity" experience into my own immutable on-chain Integration Crystal (SBT). | permanently record my growth trajectory and enrich my on-chain digital identity. |

## 4. Core Design Philosophy: Experience is Everything, Sovereignty is Personal

1.  **Experience First**: The user's entire journey should focus on the **direct experience and effect** of the "knowing-doing transformation." We provide the magic, not the magic tutorial.
2.  **Sovereignty by Design**: We don't "promise" to protect user privacy; we **ensure** user privacy through technology. The ownership of all data and assets belongs to the user from the very beginning.

## 5. Feature Details (Initial Concepts)

### 5.1. User System

*   **Function**: Decentralized identity authentication based on the NEAR wallet.
*   **Specifications**:
    *   **Login Method**: Users log in by connecting their NEAR wallet. The wallet address is the user's unique identifier. No registration, password, or email required.
    *   **Data Sovereignty Statement**: Next to the "Connect Wallet" button, there must be clear text: "By connecting your wallet, you agree to our Terms of Service. Your data will be encrypted with your private key, and we cannot access it. You own your AI and your data."

### 5.2. Integration Crystal (SBT)

*   **Strategic Positioning**: This is the core Web3 feature of the product, the embodiment of "growth assetization," and key to user retention and perceived value.
*   **Function**: After a successful "knowing-doing transformation" session, guide the user to mint it as a Soul-Bound Token (SBT).
*   **Specifications**:
    *   **Trigger**: The minting option appears after the user completes the "review" phase.
    *   **Customization**: The user can name this Integration Crystal (e.g., "First Reconciliation with Perfectionism") and choose a visual pattern generated by the AI that represents this experience.
    *   **On-Chain Data**: The SBT's metadata can include (with user consent and encryption) anonymized information such as `crystal_name`, `date_acquired`, `associated_challenge_type` (e.g., procrastination, fear).
    *   **Interaction**: The minting process requires the user to sign a transaction in their wallet and pay a small gas fee. Upon successful minting, the Integration Crystal will appear in the user's wallet and in their personal achievement showcase in MyNearAI.

### 5.3. Minimalist Dialogue Feedback

*   **Function**: To provide the team with a low-cost, high-efficiency channel for collecting "magical" and "clumsy" AI responses.
*   **Specifications**:
    *   **Interaction**: Long-pressing on any AI response bubble brings up a minimalist menu with two options: `[üëç Very helpful]` and `[üëé A bit weird]`.
    *   **Data Reporting**: When a user clicks, the frontend sends the `Message` ID, session ID, and feedback type (`good`/`bad`) to the backend. **This data is completely anonymous and not associated with any wallet address**.
    *   **MVP Goal**: This feature will **not produce any frontend UI changes or immediate backend responses** in the MVP phase. Its sole purpose is to provide data fuel for the team to analyze and optimize AI performance in the background.

### 5.4. Future Exploration (V1.1+)

*   **"Light Transmission" Social Sharing**:
    *   **Core Idea**: Design a restrained yet warm social sharing method that spreads through "gifting" rather than "showing off," perfectly matching the product's tone.
    *   **Interaction Example**: On the details page of an "Integration Crystal," provide a core interaction button `[ Pass this light to a friend ]`. After clicking, the user can share the energy contained in this crystal (such as the crystal's name and an encouraging comment generated by the AI) with a specific friend via private message.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

| Category | Requirement Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Privacy & Security** | 1. All user conversation content must be end-to-end encrypted during transmission and storage by default on the client side.<br>2. The smart contract code must be audited by a third party. |
| **Performance** | 1. DApp loading time should be less than 3 seconds.<br>2. AI response time should be controlled to an average of under 2 seconds.<br>3. Interactions with the NEAR blockchain (e.g., querying SBTs, initiating transactions) must have clear loading and waiting state indicators. |
| **Ethical Boundaries** | 1. **Non-Therapeutic Disclaimer**: It must be clearly stated in a prominent place in the DApp and in the Terms of Service that this product is **not a medical device or a professional psychotherapy tool**.<br>2. **Minimum Viable Crisis Intervention (MVP Core Feature)**: A keyword monitoring list **must** be established. If a user shows severe risk tendencies such as self-harm or suicide, the regular dialogue must be **immediately interrupted**, and a full-screen page with authoritative help hotlines must be forcibly displayed. This is a prerequisite for MVP launch. |

## Appendix A: Key Technical Implementation Points

### A.1. On-Chain Data Model

*   **User Identity**: Directly use the user's NEAR wallet address (`wallet_address`).
*   **Integration Crystal (SBT)**: An NFT smart contract compliant with the NEP-177 standard.
    | Field Name (Metadata) | Type | Description |
    | :--- | :--- | :--- |
    | `title` | STRING | Crystal name (user-named) |
    | `description` | STRING | AI-generated summary of the breakthrough |
    | `media` | URL | Points to the crystal's visual pattern stored on Arweave |
    | `issued_at` | TIMESTAMP | Timestamp of when it was awarded |
    | `attributes` | ARRAY | An array of key-value pairs describing the crystal's traits, e.g., `{"trait_type": "Challenge", "value": "Perfectionism"}` |

### A.2. Off-Chain Data

*   **Conversation History**: The user's conversation history can be encrypted and stored on decentralized storage (like Ceramic Network or Arweave), with access controlled by the user's DID. For the MVP phase, it can also be stored encrypted in the browser's local storage to simplify the architecture.

### A.3. Core Backend Logic (`chat` Function)

*   The `chat` function can be a stateless function deployed on a centralized server or a decentralized compute network.
*   **Logic**:
    1.  Receive the encrypted user message from the request.
    2.  **[Safety First]** Check the decrypted message content against the **crisis intervention keyword list**. If matched, interrupt immediately and return a crisis intervention signal.
    3.  Construct an appropriate prompt based on the "AI Dialogue Design SOP" and call the AI model service.
    4.  Return the encrypted AI response to the client.

### A.4. Global Design System (Reference)

*   **Color**: Use a dark base color (e.g., `#121212`) to create a focused atmosphere. Core interactions and highlights can use high-contrast colors (e.g., `#E0E0E0` and `#FFD700`).
*   **Font**: Prioritize system UI fonts for performance and consistency.
*   **Sound & Haptics**:
    *   Message send/receive: Subtle, non-intrusive sound and haptic feedback.
    *   Integration Crystal birth: Should have a clear, positive "completion" or "achievement" sound and haptic feedback (e.g., a singing bowl sound).
*   **AI Visual Form**: The initial form of the AI in the interface should be a **pure, warm, faintly glowing orb** to convey a minimalist and zen-like product feel.
